Overview

This project provides an interactive dashboard that visualizes power grid reliability across U.S. states from 2013–2023.
The dashboard highlights trends in SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index), SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index), and CAIDI (Customer Average Interruption Duration Index) — the three industry-standard metrics for reliability.

The tool allows users to:

Explore reliability by state and year.

Visualize performance through a choropleth map of the U.S.

Track trends over time with dynamic charts.

Generate executive-style insights that quantify performance gaps and highlight key trends.

Motivation

Growing up in Florida, I experienced firsthand the disruptions caused by hurricanes and grid failures. These events inspired me to build a visualization that makes reliability data more transparent, actionable, and accessible. The goal is to connect data insights with the broader conversation on grid hardening and resilience, which are crucial for both economic productivity and national competitiveness.

Data Source

The dashboard uses the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Form 861-A dataset.
Specifically, it focuses on the IEEE standard methodology for calculating SAIDI, SAIFI, and CAIDI.
Data has been cleaned, consolidated, and aligned across states and years (2013–2023).
