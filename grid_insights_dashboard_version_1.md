# Executive Summary: U.S. Distribution Reliability (2013–2023)

## National Reliability Trends (2013–2023)

**CAIDI – Restoration Time (minutes)**  
The national average CAIDI decreased from about 190 minutes in 2013 to roughly 161 minutes in 2015, showing improvements in outage restoration. Spikes occurred in 2017 (~248 minutes), 2020 (~300 minutes), and 2021 (~261 minutes). The increase during 2020–2021 coincides with significant weather events, including the February 2021 Texas winter storm.  

**SAIDI – Outage Duration (minutes)**  
In 2015, the average customer experienced around 168 minutes of outages. This rose to ~248 minutes in 2017 and ~300 minutes in 2020, remaining at elevated levels in 2021. Variability was high, with year-over-year standard deviation ranging from ~156 minutes (2015) to ~855 minutes (2021), reflecting how strongly major storms influence annual totals.  

**SAIFI – Outage Frequency (interruptions per customer)**  
SAIFI remained relatively stable between 1.2 and 1.4 interruptions per customer, with peaks from 2017 to 2022. Correlation across the metrics is strong: SAIDI and CAIDI correlate at approximately 0.92, and SAIDI and SAIFI at approximately 0.59. This means areas with longer outage durations often also report more frequent outages.

## State-Level Reliability Patterns

**States with shorter average outage durations (lower mean SAIDI):**  
District of Columbia, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico consistently reported shorter average outage durations and fewer interruptions. For example, the District of Columbia averaged ~81 minutes of SAIDI with a SAIFI of 0.58 interruptions per customer.  

**States with longer average outage durations (higher mean SAIDI):**  
Louisiana, Mississippi, Michigan, West Virginia, and Maine recorded higher average outage durations. Louisiana averaged ~1,303 minutes of SAIDI per customer per year, and Mississippi averaged ~597 minutes.  

**States with the most notable reductions in outage duration or restoration times:**  
Rhode Island, South Carolina, and South Dakota recorded significant decreases in CAIDI and SAIDI across the decade. These trends suggest improvements linked to infrastructure enhancements and reliability programs. North Dakota, Delaware, Wyoming, Utah, and New Hampshire showed the largest declines in SAIFI, indicating fewer interruptions per customer.  

**States with larger increases in outage metrics:**  
Some states reported upward trends in restoration times, outage duration, or frequency. For example, Louisiana’s CAIDI increased by about 69.8 minutes per year and its SAIDI by about 218.7 minutes per year. Hawaii, Alaska, Tennessee, and Texas experienced increases in SAIFI, pointing to higher reported outage frequency during the period.

## Interpretation and Context

The data reflect progress in restoration times in the early years of the decade, with increases in 2017 and again during 2020–2021 when severe storms had major impacts. Events such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017, and the Texas winter storm in 2021, extended outages and restoration efforts.  

The strong correlations among SAIDI, SAIFI, and CAIDI suggest that improvements in infrastructure hardening, system automation, and fault detection can produce benefits across all three measures. Examples from states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina show that targeted reliability initiatives can reduce both outage duration and frequency.

## Definitions

**SAIDI**  
System Average Interruption Duration Index. The average total duration of interruptions that a customer experiences in a year. Measured in minutes per customer.  

**SAIFI**  
System Average Interruption Frequency Index. The average number of interruptions that a customer experiences in a year. Measured in interruptions per customer.  

**CAIDI**  
Customer Average Interruption Duration Index. The average time to restore service per interruption. Defined as SAIDI divided by SAIFI. Measured in minutes per interruption.
